# Budget Buddy - Recent Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed & Features Added

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Reprocess Error - "Receipt not found"

**Problem**: When clicking "Reprocess with Feedback" in the extraction chat, the error "Receipt not found" appeared.

**Root Cause**: The reprocess endpoint only checked `receipts_storage` (for synchronous uploads) but not `upload_service.jobs` (for async uploads).

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `/api/receipts/{receipt_id}/reprocess` endpoint to check both storage locations
- Now properly handles both async and sync uploaded receipts

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/api/routes/receipts.py` - Added async job checking in reprocess endpoint

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Removed Extraction Chat Sidebar

**Change**: Removed the floating chat sidebar component that appeared during receipt confirmation.

**Rationale**: Cleaner UI, simpler user flow - users can now focus on reviewing and confirming receipt data.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/confirm/[receiptId]/page.tsx` - Removed ExtractionChatSidebar import and usage

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Added Transaction History Tab

**Feature**: New "Transaction History" tab on the upload page showing all receipts (pending, processing, completed, and failed).

**Capabilities**:
- ‚úÖ View all uploaded receipts with status
- ‚úÖ See real-time processing progress
- ‚úÖ Click completed receipts to view/edit
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh every 5 seconds to catch updates
- ‚úÖ Status indicators with icons and colors

**Status Colors**:
- üü¢ **Completed** - Green badge, clickable
- üîµ **Processing** - Blue badge with progress bar
- üü° **Pending** - Yellow badge
- üî¥ **Failed** - Red badge with error message

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/components/ReceiptHistory.tsx` - New history component

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Added tabs interface (Upload | History)
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Added `getAll()` method
- `backend/app/api/routes/receipts.py` - Added `GET /receipts/` endpoint
